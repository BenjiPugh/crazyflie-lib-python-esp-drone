There are a number of APIs in the Crazyflie eco system on multiple levels, some might be obvious while others are a bit
more subtle. Some of the APIs are documented and versioned while there is room for improvement in other cases.

Please see the section in the firmware documentation related to
[APIs and versions](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/development/apis_versions_deprecation/)
for more information.
